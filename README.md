# Hack the Vibe Workshop 2025 Landing Page

This repository contains the landing page for the **Vibe Coding Workshop** led by **Dr. Adnan Masood**. The site introduces attendees to the vibe-coding mindset—disciplined, production-minded delivery powered by AI pair programmers—and outlines the experience for the three-hour session.

## Workshop Snapshot
- **Focus:** Vibe Coding — disciplined, test-first software delivery accelerated by AI assistants.
- **Format:** Design-first, TDD-oriented flow with repo-aware tools and strict review gates.
- **Outcome:** Participants practice translating specs to code, collaborating with AI copilots, and shipping production-quality slices.

## Agenda (3 Hours)
| Time        | Session                                                                 |

| 00:00–00:45 | Intro & Warm-up (Tic-Tac-Toe), design-first walkthrough, repo setup     |
| 00:45–01:25 | Tool Circuit 1 — Cursor, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude (hands-on)     |
| 01:25–01:35 | Break (10 min) — "work-during-break" checklist                          |
| 01:35–02:00 | Hands-on Lab (25 min) — take one slice TDD → green                       |
| 02:00–02:40 | Tool Circuit 2 — v0.app, Firebase, Lovable, OpenAI Codex                 |
| 02:40–02:50 | Break (10 min) — prep PR, ask AI to summarize                            |
| 02:50–03:00 | Wrap-up, metrics, Q&A                                                    |

## Warm-up & Practice Goals
- Translate a user story into acceptance tests before writing code.
- Ship a tiny feature with an AI assistant through tight feedback loops.
- Practice crisp prompts and review gates while playing Tic-Tac-Toe (X vs AI O).

## Work-During-Break Checklist
1. Convert your design into a functional and non-functional checklist.
2. Identify risky edge cases and cover them with tests (red first).
3. Draft a pull request summary with highlights, risks, and test evidence.

## Tool Circuit Highlights
- **Cursor:** Repo-aware IDE assistant for chat, patches, and whole-repo edits.
- **GitHub Copilot:** IDE/PR/CLI assistant for tests, PR summaries, and review hints.
- **ChatGPT:** Design docs, code scaffolding, data shaping, and reasoning support.
- **Claude:** Live artifacts, plans, and code tools.
- **v0.app:** Prompt-to-Next.js UI generation with exportable code.
- **Firebase:** Genkit/AI logic, auth, hosting, and Firestore for fast backends.
- **Lovable:** Chat-to-app/site builder with live previews.
- **OpenAI Codex:** CLI/tool scaffolding and spec-to-code translation.
- **Also featuring:** Sourcegraph Cody and Replit Agent for supplemental assistance.

## Definitions at a Glance
- **Vibe Coding:** Disciplined, test-first delivery where humans own design and review, and AI accelerates execution.
- **AI-Augmented:** Human leads the work while AI accelerates concrete steps (tests, stubs, refactors, PR docs).
- **Agentic Coding:** Autonomous agents execute multi-step plans under constraints, with human approval gates.

## Landing Page Notes
- Built as a single-file SPA with hacker vibes and neon accents.
